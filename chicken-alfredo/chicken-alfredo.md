Cashew Chicken Alfredo
======================

Modified from http://vegweb.com/index.php?topic=17310.0 - we use Soy Curls in
this recipe.

Ingredients
-----------
1/2 cup raw cashews
1 1/2 cups boiling water (best to use starchy pasta-cooking water)
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1-3 garlic cloves, to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
salt and pepper, to taste

Directions
----------

Sauce:

1. Hydrate soy curls.  Set aside for ten minutes.

2. Place raw (not roasted!) in a food processor and pulse until nuts are very
fine. Carefully add in the boiling water; process until smooth.

3. Add the lemon juice, garlic, olive oil and nutritional yeast; process again
until smooth. 

4. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper.

5. Put sauce in a pan over medium heat.  After it starts thickening, add soy
curls to the pan.

Serve over cooked pasta.
